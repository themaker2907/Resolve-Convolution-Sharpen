A resolve DCTL plugin designed for sharpening video using convolution sharpening. Ideal for sharpning the soft video seen with Canon DSLR cameras (such as the Canon 5D mark iii) to gain a more detailed, crispy, and unhaloed image

This plugin only works with the studio version of resolve, as the free edition does not support DCTLs

There is alot of information about this in the wiki page, so please have a look
